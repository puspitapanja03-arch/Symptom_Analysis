# Symptom_Analysor_Agent
Description:

The Symptom Detector is an AI-powered medical assistance system designed to classify a patient’s reported symptoms into specific categories such as General, Emergency, or Mental Health.
The system interacts with users, takes their symptom as input, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently classify the condition. Based on the classification, it directs the user to the appropriate department — e.g., general ward, emergency help, or counseling.

This project demonstrates the integration of natural language understanding in healthcare triage systems for faster and more accurate patient routing.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

LangChain – for managing prompt logic and LLM workflow

LangGraph – to design the conversational or state-based workflow

Google Generative AI (Gemini API) – used for symptom classification

OpenAI / Langchain Core – for message management and state tracking

OS & Getpass modules – for secure environment key handling

👩‍💻 Role / Contribution:

Developed a state-based workflow using LangGraph to handle symptom collection, classification, and routing logic.

Integrated Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for intelligent medical symptom classification.

Created and tested custom nodes for General, Emergency, and Mental Health cases.

Implemented secure API key handling and structured interactive input/output flow for the system.

Contributed to the design and debugging of the logic for accurate classification and user-friendly responses.
